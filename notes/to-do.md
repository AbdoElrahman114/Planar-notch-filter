    - [ ] Optimize for minimal reflection and maximum rejection.

4. **Implementation Phase (Optional):**

    - [ ] Fabricate the prototype using PCB etching or milling techniques.
    - [ ] Test the fabricated design with a **Vector Network Analyzer (VNA)**.

5. **Performance Evaluation:**

    - [ ] Verify metrics: rejection (>30 dB), bandwidth, and resonance accuracy.
    - [ ] Compare simulation results with theoretical results.

6. **Final Report and Presentation:**

    - [ ] Combine analysis, design, and implementation results in a structured format.
    - [ ] Include challenges faced, solutions applied, and a comparison with theoretical results.
    - [ ] Compile findings, including theoretical background, design schematics, and performance metrics.
    - [ ] Create visual aids: frequency response plots and circuit diagrams.
    - [ ] Prepare and deliver a presentation summarizing the project.
